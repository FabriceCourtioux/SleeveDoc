## Materials

A set of materials is necessary for product design: fabric, lining, button, felt, elbow patch, satin, badge, stitch.

Example configuration for fabrics :

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr class="border-0">
            <td align="left" width="450" class="border-0">
                <img src="../Images/Administration/Fabrics.png" alt="New fabric" class="shadow-sm" />
            </td>
            <td class="border-0"></td>
            <td width="350" class="border-0">
                A bundle can be defined but not obligatory. This allows you to refine searches.<br/><br/>
                 The 'visible' property allows you to hide an element during queries without deleting it. Example: A fabric is being integrated but should not be visible.<br/><br/>
                 Enter the reference, unique identifier and its name which is a complement for the display.<br/><br/>
                 The nature of the fabric and the category can also refine the selection.<br/><br/>
                 The price indicated is first level. It can be redefined when selecting fabrics by model.<br/><br/>
                 The chosen image must be in JPG format. It will be saved with a height of 500 pixels and a thumbnail of 35 pixels.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
